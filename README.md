# RESTAURANT CHECKLIST

This project is designed for users to click on a restaurant from a list that they visited and provide a personal rating and comment to it.  This app is design to log all the places that they went as a personal use.  

Users can also submit newly discovered restaurants and input location and image, which will then display on BOTH the restaurant and user's favorites to grow and expand the list of restaurants at the Add Restaurant Page.  

Users have the option to delete the restaurant for personal reasons.  (Warning: Information deleted cannot be retrieved.)
