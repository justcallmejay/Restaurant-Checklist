# RESTAURANT CHECKLIST

This app is a simple tracker that logs all the resturants that the users visited as customers.  It is designed for users to click on a restaurant from a list that they visited and provide a personal rating, comment, and keep track of the number of times the user became a customer at that establishment.  

Users can also submit newly discovered restaurants and input location and image, which will then display on the restaurant and (optimal) the user's page to grow and expand the list of restaurants at the Restaurant Page.  This will help your Eat-Go account build more locations for the user to track and enjoy.

Features of the app:

Rating:

Loved it?  Hated it?  Express it using a numeric rating between 1 through 5.  Once selected, the restaurant will upgrade and deliver a new average on the restaurant card.  If at some point your experience has changed, you may delete it and re-select the restaurant.

Comment:

Put your expression into words here.  Write your experiences about the restaurant: the food, atmosphere, services, cost, etc.

Counter:

Track the number of times you visited the restaurant by simply clicking the + button.  It will temporarily freeze before user may click again..

Users have the option to delete the restaurant from their My Visit Page for personal reasons.  (Warning: Information deleted such as comments, ratings, and visit count cannot be retrieved!)
