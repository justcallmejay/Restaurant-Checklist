# RESTAURANT CHECKLIST

This app is a simple tracker that logs all the eateries that they visited as a customer.  It is designed for users to click on a restaurant from a list that they visited and provide a personal rating, comment, and keep track of the number of times the user became a customer at that establishment.  

Users can also submit newly discovered restaurants and input location and image, which will then display on the restaurant and (optimal) the user's page to grow and expand the list of restaurants at the Restaurant Page.  This will help Eat-Go build more locations for the user to track and enjoy.

Users have the option to delete the restaurant from their My Visit Page for personal reasons.  (Warning: Information deleted such as comments, ratings, and visit count cannot be retrieved.)
